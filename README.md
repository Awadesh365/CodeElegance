# Online_code_editor_js

Now this project is live at- https://main--dulcet-kleicha-e97ecc.netlify.app/

# Project Information

 an online code editor that allows users to write and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The code is written in JavaScript and uses the Ace editor library to provide a rich text editor for each of the three languages. The code also uses an iframe to display the output of the code.

The code works as follows:

The user enters HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code into the corresponding editor.
When the user clicks on the "Run" button, the code is passed to the Ace editor library, which compiles and executes the code.
The output of the code is displayed in the iframe.
The code editor also includes a number of features that make it easy to write and edit code, such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error checking.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
